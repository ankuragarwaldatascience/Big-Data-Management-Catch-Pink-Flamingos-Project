"Catch the Pink Flamingo" is a highly popular mobile game produced by the imaginary company Eglence Inc.

Catch the pink flamingos is an online game where players attempt to capture maximum pink flamingos as possible. During each level, the game will provide real-time prompts to help you move through the maps. The complexity of the maps and mission speed increase as the user advances through the levels.

Pink Flamingos in this multiplayer game are randomly generated on a world map as players reach goals that fluctuate in real-time.

The first thing players (users) do after registering is play Level 1 individually with no teammates. At this point in the game, the player starts building history and getting trained. A player is only allowed to be assigned to one team. It's easy to learn how to play the game on Level 1. Once the user finishes Level 1, the user is given the option of joining a team or forming one of their own. The user will then continue as a team player throughout the rest of the program. The team can be as small as one person.

The game automatically creates a new map each time it begins a new level, adding more cells to the previous map. Additionally, missions become more complicated as the game progresses. Missions also change more often as levels rise.

Players communicate via chat boards assigned to each team as well as social media, such as Twitter.

This project uses nine files that contain in-app purchase and ad click data, as well as six files that contain chat information. It was a data science development team that generated all the data for the project. The data was used to simulate a wide range of aspects of the game play and in-game user activities.

As part of the project, a decision tree is fitted and a cluster analysis using k-means is carried out. In addition, it uses graph analytics to identify the chattiest users/teams, the longest conversations, and the most active user groups.

KNIME, Splunk, Spark, Python, and Neo4j were used in this project for analysis.

Next, we will describe the Catch the Pink Flamingo game and then discuss the data model and data sets associated with the game.
