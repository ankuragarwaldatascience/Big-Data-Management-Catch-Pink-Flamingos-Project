This project uses nine files that contain in-app purchase and ad click data, as well as six files that contain chat information. It was a data science development team that generated all the data for the project. The data was used to simulate a wide range of aspects of the game play and in-game user activities.

As part of the project, a decision tree is fitted and a cluster analysis using k-means is carried out. In addition, it uses graph analytics to identify the chattiest users/teams, the longest conversations, and the most active user groups.

KNIME, Splunk, Spark, Python, and Neo4j were used in this project for analysis.

Next, we will describe the Catch the Pink Flamingo game and then discuss the data model and data sets associated with the game.
