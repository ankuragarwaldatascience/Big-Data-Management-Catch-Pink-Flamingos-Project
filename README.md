# Catch Pink Flamingos Game

Tech Stack , Tools and Skills  Required for Project


Big Data Management

Managing big data involves organizing, managing, and governing large volumes of structured and unstructured data. A big data management system is designed to ensure high data quality and accessibility for big data analytics and business intelligence.


Outcomes of Learning

1.Analyze the paradigms of modern big data processing critically.
2.Implement a big data solution using a dataset provided.
3.Implement a big data solution after analyzing use cases, visualizing results, and reporting them.
4.Using Big Data as a solution, assess how ethics drive design decisions.


Observations:

Developing an understanding of the impact of big data solutions on business growth is an essential skill for the industry. Through hands-on experience with the tools and systems used by big data scientists and engineers, this assignment will walk you through the different stages of developing a big data solution. As a result, it will enable the user to ask the right questions about data, communicate effectively with data scientists, and perform basic explorations of large, complex datasets.

"Catch the Pink Flamingo" is a highly popular mobile game produced by the imaginary company Eglence Inc.

Catch the pink flamingos is an online game where players attempt to capture maximum pink flamingos as possible. During each level, the game will provide real-time prompts to help you move through the maps. The complexity of the maps and mission speed increase as the user advances through the levels.

Pink Flamingos in this multiplayer game are randomly generated on a world map as players reach goals that fluctuate in real-time.

The first thing players (users) do after registering is play Level 1 individually with no teammates. At this point in the game, the player starts building history and getting trained. A player is only allowed to be assigned to one team. It's easy to learn how to play the game on Level 1. Once the user finishes Level 1, the user is given the option of joining a team or forming one of their own. The user will then continue as a team player throughout the rest of the program. The team can be as small as one person.

The game automatically creates a new map each time it begins a new level, adding more cells to the previous map. Additionally, missions become more complicated as the game progresses. Missions also change more often as levels rise.

Players communicate via chat boards assigned to each team as well as social media, such as Twitter.

This project uses nine files that contain in-app purchase and ad click data, as well as six files that contain chat information. It was a data science development team that generated all the data for the project. The data was used to simulate a wide range of aspects of the game play and in-game user activities.

As part of the project, a decision tree is fitted and a cluster analysis using k-means is carried out. In addition, it uses graph analytics to identify the chattiest users/teams, the longest conversations, and the most active user groups.

KNIME, Splunk, Spark, Python, and Neo4j were used in this project for analysis.

Next, we will describe the Catch the Pink Flamingo game and then discuss the data model and data sets associated with the game.
